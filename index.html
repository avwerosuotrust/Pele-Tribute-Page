      <li>Edson Arantes do Nascimento known mononymously by his nickname Pele, was (born October 23, 1940) in the town of  Tres Coracoes in Minas Gerais state in Brazil</li>
      <li><span>1956</span> de Brito took Pele to Santos, an industrial and port city located near Sao Paulo, to try out for professional club Santos FC, telling the directors at Santos that the 15-year-old would be "the greatest football player in the world." Pele impressed Santos coach Lula during his trial at the Estadio Vila Belmiro, and he signed a professional contract with the club in June 1956. Pele was highly promoted in the local media as a future superstar. He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the age of 15 against Corinthians de Santo Andre and had an impressive performance in a 7-1 victory, scoring the first goal in his prolific career during the match</li>
      <li><span>29 June 1958 World Cup</span> Pele became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5-2 in Stockholm, the capital. Pele hit the post and then Vava scored two goals to give Brazil the lead. Pele's first goal, where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup.</li>
      <li><span>1959 South American Championship</span> Pele also played in the South American Championship. In the 1959 competition he was named best player of the tournament and was the top scorer with eight goals, as Brazil came second despite being unbeaten in the tournament. He scored in five of Brazil's six games, including two goals against Chile and a hat-trick against Paraguay.</li>
      <li><span>1966 World Cup</span> Pele was the most famous footballer in the world during the 1966 World Cup in England, and Brazil fielded some world champions like Garrincha, Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the addition of other stars like Jairzinho, Tostao and Gerson, leading to high expectations for them. Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for brutal fouls on Pele that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.</li>
      <li><span>1962 World Cup</span> In the first match of the 1962 World Cup in Chile, against Mexico, Pele assisted the first goal and then scored the second one, after a run past four defenders, to go up 2-0. He got injured in the next game while attempting a long-range shot against Czechoslovakia. This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament, and forced coach Aymore Moreira to make his only lineup change of the tournament. The substitute was Amarildo, who performed well for the rest of the tournament. However, it was Garrincha who would take the leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title, after beating Czechoslovakia at the final in Santiago.</li>
      <li><span>1966 World Cup</span>Pele was the most famous footballer in the world during the 1966 World Cup in England, and Brazil fielded some world champions like Garrincha, Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the addition of other stars like Jairzinho, Tostao and Gerson, leading to high expectations for them. Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for brutal fouls on Pele that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.</li> 
      <li><span>1970 World Cup</span> Brazil played Italy in the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pele scored the opening goal with a header after out jumping Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. Brazil's 100th World Cup goal, Pele's leap of joy into the arms of teammate Jairzinho in celebrating the goal is regarded as one of the most iconic moments in World Cup history. He then made assists for Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth finished by Carlos Alberto. The last goal of the game is often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team's outfield players. The play culminated after Pele made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto's running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4-1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pele received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament.</li>
      <li><span>1971</span> Pele's last international match was on 18 July 1971 against Yugoslavia in Rio de Janeiro. With Pele on the field, the Brazilian team's record was 67 wins, 14 draws, and 11 losses. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Pele and Garrincha.</li>
      <li><span>2014</span> In January 2014, Pele was awarded the first ever FIFA Ballon d'Or Prix d'Honneur as an acknowledgment from the world governing body of the sport for his contribution to world football.</li>
      <li><span>2022</span> On 21 December 2022, the Albert Einstein Hospital, where Pele was being treated, stated that his tumour had advanced and he required "greater care related to renal and cardiac dysfunctions". Pele died on 29 December 2022, at the age of 82, due to multiple organ failure, a complication of colon cancer.</li>
